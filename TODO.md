## Assets Needed

- [ ] **Product screenshots / demo video** — Hero section and How It Works visuals.
      Add files to a `media/` folder; once provided, will be embedded in the hero and step sections.

- [ ] **OG share image** — A 1200×630 social preview card image.
      Currently falling back to `Logos/logo_512x512.png`.
      Ideally branded card with tagline text for better social sharing.

## Services / Endpoints

- [ ] **Contact form endpoint** — Currently shows a client-side "Thank you" alert.
      Options: Formspree, Netlify Forms, Cloudflare Workers, or custom backend.
      Once provided, update `pages/contact.html` form `action` attribute and replace the temporary client-side success simulation.

## Social / Branding

      Update footer social links across all 8 HTML files once confirmed.

- [ ] **LinkedIn company page** — Currently placeholder `linkedin.com/company/reportdrafter`.
      Update once real page is created.

- [ ] **Twitter Card metadata** — `twitter:site` and `twitter:creator` handles.
      Will add to all pages once handles are confirmed.

## Content / Copy

- [ ] **Real testimonial quotes & names** — Current testimonials are realistic placeholders.
      Replace with actual customer feedback when available.

- [ ] **Company logo strip** — Trust strip currently text-only (industry names).
      Supply partner/client logos to upgrade to a visual logo carousel.

## Deployment

      `sitemap.xml` and canonical URLs already reference `reportdrafter.com`.

      Provide GA4 measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXX`) to add tracking snippet.
